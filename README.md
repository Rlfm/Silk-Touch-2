# Silk-Touch-2
A Minecraft Plugin for Spigot 1.16.5

This plugin adds a new level to the "Silk Touch" enchantment, which allows to harvest monsters' spawners. This enchantment is hard to get as this feature is supposed to be an endgame one.

Silk Touch II can only be obtained via the enchantment table :
  - When your tool is supposed to get the Silk Touch enchantment, there is a 30% chance (can be modified in the config.yml file) it gets the Silk Touch II enchantment instead.
  - Silk Touch II cannot be obtained when enchanting a book, nor by merging Silk Touch I items in an anvil.
  
Additional features :
  - Spawners' statistics can be modified in the config.yml file.
  - Stops spawners from being broken without a Silk Touch II tool.
